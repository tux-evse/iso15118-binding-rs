       gnutls_init - API function

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <gnutls/gnutls.h>[0m

       [1mint gnutls_init(gnutls_session_t * [4m[22msession[24m[1m, unsigned int [4m[22mflags[24m[1m);[0m

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       gnutls_session_t * session
                   is a pointer to a [1mgnutls_session_t [22mtype.

       unsigned int flags
                   indicate if this session is to be used for server or client.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This  function  initializes  the  provided session. Every session must be initialized before use, and after successful initialization and use must be
       deinitialized by calling [1mgnutls_deinit()[22m.

        [4mflags[24m can be any combination of flags from [1mgnutls_init_flags_t[22m.

       Note that since version 3.1.2 this function enables some common TLS extensions such as session tickets and OCSP certificate status request in  client
       side by default. To prevent that use the [1mGNUTLS_NO_DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS [22mflag.

       Note  that  it  is  never  mandatory  to  use  [1mgnutls_deinit()  [22mafter  this  function  fails.   Since gnutls 3.8.0, it is safe to unconditionally use
       [1mgnutls_deinit() [22meven after failure regardless of whether the memory was initialized prior to [1mgnutls_init()[22m; however, clients wanting to  be  portable
       to  older  versions of the library should either skip deinitialization on failure, or pre-initialize the memory passed in to [1mgnutls_init() [22mto all ze‚Äê
       roes via [1mmemset() [22mor similar.

[1mRETURNS[0m
       [1mGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS [22mon success, or an error code.
